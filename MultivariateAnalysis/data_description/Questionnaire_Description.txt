The file “questionnaire.txt” includes: 31 questions on the following 9 variables:

Q: a numeric vector for the question number
A: a numeric vector for the response from student 1
B: a numeric vector for the response from student 2
C: a numeric vector for the response from student 3
D: a numeric vector for the response from student 4
E: a numeric vector for the response from student 5
F: a numeric vector for the response from student 6
G: a numeric vector for the response from student 7
H: a numeric vector for the response from student 8


Student responses to the questionnaires are evaluated using the following scores:

1 = strongly disagree
2 = disagree
3 = neutral
4 = agree
5 = strongly agree


The 31 questions are described as follows:
                                                        
1            I learned a lot  
2            Statisticians can get along without most of this stuff.  
3            If I had know what it was like I wouldn't have taken it.  
4            The course should be given before consulting work.   
5            I think I will be able to use most of the material.   
6            The course was interesting   
7            I was thrown into the computer without preparation.  
8            A working knowledge of FORTRAN should be a prerequisite.   
9            More emphasis should be placed on complete packages.  
10          My mathematical background was sufficient.   
11          I didn't know enough statistical theory to understand.  
12          Too much was assumed about elementary data analysis.   
13          I was adequately prepared.  
14          I had to do too much work myself.   
15          I spent to much time at the Computer Center fiddling.   
16          The computing was more fun than the statistics.  
17          There weren't enough interesting data sets.  
18          There should be more packaged programs.   
19          I want to write my own subroutines.  
20          We shouldn't waste a session on student projects.   
21          I would prefer not to have my work criticized in public.   
22          The level of student participation is about right.  
23          We went through too much, too fast, to grasp anything.  
24          I want more correlations and factor analysis.  
25          We spent too much time on clustering.  
26          We should consider only real variables, let 0-1 category go.   
27          We need to discuss time series.  
28          Too much emphasis on trivial data analysis like plots.  
29          More time on regression and analysis of variance.  
30          A more mathematical treatment, please. 
31          The course content was about right.
